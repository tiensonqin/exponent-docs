# Exponent Documentation

Hi! This is what will make Exponent actually be useable by people. :)


## How to edit

#### A note about versioning

Exponent's SDK is versioned so that apps made on old SDKs are still supported
when new SDKs are relased. The website documents previous SDK versions too.

Version names correspond to directory names under `versions/`.

`unversioned` is a special version for the next SDK release. `devdocs` isn't
actually an SDK version, it's a special version that corresponds to the
"Tool Developer Documentation" website.

Sometimes you want to make an edit in version `X` and have that edit also
be applied in versions `Y, Z, ...` (say, when you're fixing documentation for an
API call that existed in old versions too). You can use the
`./scripts/versionpatch.sh` utility to apply your `git diff` in one version in
other versions. For example, to update the docs in `unversioned` then apply it
on `v8.0.0` and `v7.0.0`, you'd do the following after editing the docs in
`unversioned` such that it shows up in `git diff`:

```./scripts/versionpatch.sh unversioned v8.0.0 v7.0.0```

Any changes in your `git diff` outside the `unversioned` directory are ignored
so don't worry if you have code changes or such elsewhere.

### As a random person

Thanks for helping! :D make your changes on a fork of this repository or
whatever works for you and submit a pull request. We'll take a look and
incorporate them!

### As an Exponent developer

- Make your changes in `universe/docs` and commit them. Our `shipit` bot
synchronizes the changes to the public `exponent-docs` repository. Changes will
automatically be deployed to https://docs.getexponent.com on deploy. To change
the default version, update the version key in `docs/package.json` (the
deploy script will respect this value).

### Testing changes locally

Navigate to the documentation root.

#### With Docker (recommended)

If your machine has Docker for Mac and the Gcloud tools, you can run:

```bash
DEFAULT_VERSION=[version goes here] make watch
```

from this directory. So for example, `DEFAULT_VERSION=v7.0.0 make watch` will preview
docs for sdk 7. The site is viewable at `localhost:8000`.

If you run `make watch`, it will start the previewing unversioned docs, which
is what you want in development.

If your machine does not have Docker or GCloud, do the following:

* Go to https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/ and download and install Docker for Mac.
* From universe root, run `server/infra/tools/install-cli-tools.sh`, and follow the prompts.

#### With Python (environment dependent)

Make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed. Run,

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then run,

```DEFAULT_VERSION=unversioned make serve```

This will serve the docs site accessible at the URL given in the output of the
command. This will preview the `DEFAULT_VERSION` according to the `docs/package.json`.
When you edit and save one of the docs source files it builds and refreshes the
page automatically. You can also try a specific version like this,

```DEFAULT_VERSION=v6.0.0 make serve```

The site is viewable at `http://0.0.0.0:8000/versions/unversioned/index.html`.
